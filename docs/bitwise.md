| & (AND)           | It performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | (A & B) is 2    |
| \| (OR)           | It performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | (A \| B) is 3   |
| & (XOR)           | It performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. Exclusive OR means that either operand one is true or operand two is true, but not both.                                                                                                                      | (A ^ B) is 1    |
| !(NOT)            | It is a unary operator and operates by reversing all the bits in the operand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | (!A ) is -3     |
| \<< (Left Shift)  | It moves all the bits in its first operand to the left by the number of places specified in the second operand. New bits are filled with zeros. Shifting a value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying it by 2, shifting two positions is equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on. | (A \<\< 1) is 4 |
| \>> (Right Shift) | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operandâ€™s value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.                                                                                                                                                                       | (A >> 1) is 1   |
